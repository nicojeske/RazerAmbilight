## Function:
* Maps your screen to your Razer mouse, keyboard and mousepad to create an "ambient effect"
* You can change the saturation
* You can change the update rate to reduce the cpu load
* Settings can be found by right-clicking the program icon in your notification area on your task bar.

## Download:
You can always download the latest release from here: https://github.com/Sancas/RazerAmbilight/releases
Make sure that you have Razer Synapse running. Otherwise the app won't work.

## Note:
A Windows Smart Screen message may appear during installation. This tells you that my program is not signed by a certification authority recognized by Microsoft. Because these certifications cost a lot of money, which I cannot afford as a student, my program is therefore not signed.
